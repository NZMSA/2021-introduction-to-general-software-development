# Introduction to Git

## Introduction

So, you've written some codes, make a few changes, perhaps you already thoughts of the next 100 features to add to your website. 

But, what if you make a grave mistake and you don't have a history of your changes? What if you need to work with other people? Do you rely on your memory to try and undo your changes? Do you just email your code to our friend so they can also work on it? We need a better solution... ðŸ¤¨

**Git** is an open-source _"version control system"_. A powerful content-tracker that allows us to document code, track changes and easily collaborate with other developers. **Git** has enabled people across the world to work together and brought countless innovative project to life. Simply put, **git** is an absolute essential skills for any developers.

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll be learning how to use **git** to track your code changes as you continue building out your web application. 

We'll also be using _GitHub_, Microsoft **git** repositories hosting service to store our projects and start building out your portfolio! ðŸ”¥

## Learning Outcomes
By the end, you will be comfortable with the following:
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub.
- What git repository, commits, branches and pull request are.
- Managing code changes using basic git commands.

## Requirements / Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed.
- [ ] Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor.
- [ ] Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control system software.
- [ ] Register for a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) - For hosting & storing our project.

# 1. Creating git repository

Now that you have git installed, you can try run `git help git` command in your command prompt or terminal to see what the official manual of git has to say about itself. ðŸ™‚

1.1 Head over to GitHub and create a new git repository.

1.2 Fill out the basic repository details for your project. You can select **Add a README file**, this will initialize your repository with a markdown file used to describe your project.

![Create new repository](images/2.png)

1.3 This is your git repository (think of it as your project folder where every changes in this folder will be tracked by git). 

Right now as you can see the only file in your repository is a README.md, which is displayed by default when you visit any repositories on GitHub.

# 2. Cloning our remote repository

It wouldn't be ideal to start coding on the browser so let's clone this remote git repository to our local disk first.


2.1 Copy the url of the repository.

![Create new repository](images/3.png)

2.2 Navigate to a folder on your computer where you'd like to store your project. `Shift` + `right click` and open a powershell or command prompt inside the folder. 

2.3 Run `git clone` followed by your copied repository url. e.g. git clone https://github.com/paulvtan/my-awesome-website.git 

```
git clone [repository-url] 
```

This will download our git repository into the current folder.

As you can see our 'local' git repository looks just like the remote git repository stored on GitHub. Any changes made to this local repository will be tracked as new changes!

*_the hidden .git folder is that specify this directory as a git repository._

# 3. Making our first commit

Making a commit is like taking a snapshot of our current repository, recording changes permanently to the repository history. This allows us to progressively track changes as we develop our website, making it easy to collaborate with others. 

Git preserves a history of all commits allowing us to track what was changed and who made the change. We can even revert back to any specific commit in the history! âŒ›

Let's record our first commit to the history.

3.1 Always start with `git status` to understand the current state of your repository.

In your local repository run.

```
git status
```
Here you can see git informing us that our remote and local repository is up-to-date with each other as we haven't made any changes to the repo.

![Create new repository](images/6.png)

3.2 Let's move our project files from previous section into our local repository. Run `git status` command again.

![Create new repository](images/7.png)

Here you can see that git has detected these as untracked new files (in red) as they have not been part of the commit history.

Similarly, source control tab in VS code show us these files are untracked (U). As you can see here, VS code supports and allows us to manage git from the graphical user interace. 

But for the purpose of practicing and understanding, we'll continue to use git command to manage our changes.

3.3 Run the following command to add all changes to the staging area. This prepares current changes to be included in the next commit!

```
git add --all
```

or 

```
got add .
```
ðŸ’¡ *You can use `git clean -f` to remove untracked files. (Removes any newly added files)*

ðŸ’¡ *Use `git checkout .` to remove any changes done to tracked files. (Removes changes done to repo's existing files)* 

3.4 Run `git status` again, now you'll see in both VS Code and command prompt (or powershell) that these changes have now been staged to include in the next commit! 

ðŸ’¡ *You can use `git reset` to unstage your changes.*

![Create new repository](images/9.png)

3.5 Make the commit using the following command.

```
git commit -m "Added project files"
```
![Create new repository](images/10.png)

A commit captures a snapshot of your current repository. This commit saves your staged changes to the local repository history tree. 

You must provide a short meaningful commit message using `-m` parameter. 

Describe what this commit captures so other developers can quickly understand what the new changes are. E.g. `"Added a new sign-in button"` or `"Fixed a typo in the Welcome page"`

3.6 Run `git log` to review a commit history of your local repository.

```
git log
```

![Create new repository](images/11.png)


However, examining the commit history on GitHub repo you will see only the `Initial commit`. 


![Create new repository](images/12.png)


This is because a new commit is only on your local repository, it hasn't been synced to the remote repository on your GitHub. 

3.7 Run `git status` again, git knows that our local repository `main` branch is 1 commit ahead of our remote `origin/main` branch.

![Create new repository](images/13.png)

3.8 Run `git push` to push commits from our local repo to a remote repo. This exports commits to remote branches.

```
git push
```
3.9 If you compare `git log` again, you'll now see that our repository is now in sync with each other.

You can examine each commit to see what changes are included.

ðŸ’¡ *Always a good idea to run `git fetch` to download any new commits from the remote repository in-case there've been changes made by other developers.*

ðŸ’¡ *Or use `git pull` to fetch and merge the remote branch into the current branch.*

Familiarize yourself with `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"` and `git push` as these are basic git commands for adding new changes.
